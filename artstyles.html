<h1 id="nav">Art Styles</h1>
<p>In the world of art there diffrent art styles here were going to show you the diffrent art styles there is.<br>Starting with:</p>
<h1>Realism</h1>
<p>Realism
   is a painting art style that aims to give the viewer a reflection of the real world. Many of the most famous paintings are painted in this style and for many, paintings made in this style are what they will think of when they think of ‘art’. It is important, however, to make the distinction between realism and photorealism – the former concerns itself with a realistic scene but does not aim to be a true depiction.</p>

<h1>Photorealism</h1>
<p>You may also see photorealism referred to as hyperrealism or super-realism. This painting style aims to create a painting that’s indistinguishable from real life or a photograph – hence the name. This makes it distinct from realism, as unless you take a much closer look at a photorealism painting you will not be able to see that it is indeed a painting.</p>

<h1>Expressionism</h1>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum is expressionism. Expressionism is a style of art that doesn’t concern itself with realism, images and scenes are often distorted or painted with otherworldly, vivid colours that don’t match up with reality. The focus is instead on the artist’s ideas or feelings, which are expressed through the medium of art.</p>

<h1>Impressionism</h1>
<p>Impressionism is a painting style most commonly associated with the 19th century where small brush strokes are used to build up a larger picture. This art style lies somewhere between expressionism and realism, with a focus on accurate lighting but with no emphasis on a realistic scene</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Abstract paintings eschew realism altogether. Whatever the subject in the painting, it may not be accurately represented at all in the artwork. Objects may be represented by a colour or a shape instead, with the interpretation left up to the viewer. The impact of an abstract painting cannot be understated, with many using shocking displays of colour and form to dizzy the senses</p>

<h1>Surrealism</h1>
<p>Surrealism first became a movement in the 20th century, with artists such as Salvador Dali becoming household names. Combining abstract concepts with semi-realistic objects that have been twisted or morphed into something unusual, they can be illogical or dreamlike, giving the viewer a heightened sense of reality</p>

<h1>Pop Art</h1>
<p>In the 1950s and onwards, pop art became a movement that drew inspiration from the commodification and commercialism of modern life. Using cartoons or adverts in many of the style’s most famous works, pop art uses realistic imagery combined with bold colours to highlight the artist’s intent</p>

<h1>TYPES OF PAINTING SUBJECTS</h1>
<p>Historically paintings have been classified in five different ways, depending on the types of subjects in the painting in question. The five genres of painting subject are:</p>
<h1>History Painting</h1>
<p>These focus on a representation of a particular historical, religious, or allegorical event. As such, a moral message is usually a key component of the painting in question.</p>
<h1>Portrait Art</h1>
<p>Portrait art uses people as its subjects. The most commonly known type of portrait art focuses on a single person, but group or self-portraits are also classified under this type of painting subject</p>
<h1>Genre Painting</h1>
<p>A genre painting has an everyday scene as its subject. This differs from landscape painting as in genre painting it is the representation of life itself which is the subject. Examples may include workers going about their day or a banquet being held, what is important is the scene itself, not the individuals who make up the scene</p>
<h1>Landscape Painting</h1>
<p>Landscape paintings are one of the most popular and enduring types of subject, focusing on a natural scene. Most landscape paintings aim for a sense of realism, focusing on things like the light shining through clouds or reflecting off the water</p>
<h1>Still Life Painting</h1>
<p>A still life painting looks at everyday or domestic objects and aims to accurately represent them. This can be used as a way to practice painting techniques, such as the way colours change as light and shadow drape across an object.</p>
